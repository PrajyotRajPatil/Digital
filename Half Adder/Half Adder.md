# Half Adder

## Introduction
The Half Adder is used to add two 1 bit data i.e. to add 2 Binary bits and gives output as Sum and Carry.
It serves as a building block for more complex digital circuits.

**Half Adders can be combined with other logic gates to create a variety of digital circuits, including:**
*Full Adder,
Ripple Carry Adder,
Carry Lookahead Adder,
Digital Counters,
Multiplexers,
De-multiplexers,
Decoders,
Encoders,
Comparators.*
